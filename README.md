Hello. This assignment is part of The Odin Project Foundations course. The point of it is to create something from scratch and get the various elements in more or less the right position relative to the rest based on the provided images (desired-image.png and font-ref.png). 

This assignemnt demonstrates my ability to write HTML and basic CSS, including flex display properties. It does not currently present well-done responsive features as the point is to recreate a design from scratch.
